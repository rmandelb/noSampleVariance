# DESC-LSST hack 
Here is our [hackpad
note](https://hackpad.com/Avoiding-covariances-of-two-point-correlation-functions-dLUkAI5yrSv)


**Note:** This repository should be cloned into
  `$(COSMOSIS-INSTALL-DIR)/modules/noSampleVariance/`
  to keep the relative paths to the CosmoSIS modules consistent with
  CosmoSIS practices. The INI files for CosmoSIS runs require this
  relative path setup.

  Make sure paths are setup so that everything can be run from
  cosmosis-install-dir.
